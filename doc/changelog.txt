This file lists significant changes in OpenMalaria from the point of view of
users. It is however far from complete. The more complete changelog is on the

— 2014-04-22 — Schema 32 release candidate 3 —

Cohorts / sub-populations:

Concept of _cohorts_ partially replaced with _sub-populations_: intervention
deployments are sub-population recruitments while cohorts are a derived
concept only used in monitoring. Deployments can be restricted to
sub-populations instead of cohorts and cumulative deployment mode uses
sub-populations.

Getting output from multiple cohorts and/or cohort complements independently is
now possible.

Sub-population removal of membership on age of intervention (time since
deployment), first bout/infection/treatment event and ITN attrition.

Health system memory resets (reporting events which could have a relapse) on
remove-on-first-event sub-population removals (same as before), but not on
recruitment (which did used to happen).

Other:

Case management can use diagnostics before treating patients.

Case management can trigger deployment of any intervention.

New 'screen' intervention component which uses a diagnostic, then deploys
interventions from a list depending on outcome. Replaces MDA's diagnostic.

Integration of vivax code from the separate development branch based on schema
31.

Bug fixes. Significant cleanup of monitoring code. More restrictive parsing of
treatment descriptions (but not restricting anything actually useful).


— Schema 31 —

Replace "larviciding" intervention with far more generic "vectorPop" intervention.
