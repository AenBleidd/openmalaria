Give larviciding a decay function and more detailed effects description (if necessary).

replace #include "inputData.h" everywhere by the minimum required part of the schema.

Check for redundant variables in:
    quinquennialS_v / P_diff (both used?)
    initOvFromSv / initNv0FromSv
    initialP_A, initialP_df
    mosqEmergeRate

Does Transmission::update need isDynamic parameter?

Cross-species competition:
Olivier's model: Funestus and Arabiensis larvae shouldn't compete with each
other at all, while indoor-biting and outdoor-biting Arabiensis larvae should
compete for the same resources. Should extend SimpleMPD model to allow this.
